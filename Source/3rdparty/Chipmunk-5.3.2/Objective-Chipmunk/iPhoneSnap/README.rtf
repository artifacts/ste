\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 About Snap!\

\b0 \
Snap! is modeled after an old wooden board game I used to play. Pieces are placed on the board and a bar compresses them downwards. Players take turns removing pieces one at a time, if they cause the bar to move too far then the player loses points.\
\
The Snap! source code is available under the MIT License. The purpose is to show how simple Objective-Chipmunk makes using the Chipmunk physics library from Objective-C projects. Snap is also available from the App Store for $.99.\

\b About the Objective-Chipmunk wrapper:\

\b0 \
Objective-Chipmunk is an Objective-C wrapper for the Chipmunk Physics Library. Chipmunk was written in C to allow it to  The primary advantages of a native Objective-C API include integrating with the Cocoa memory management model and the Chipmunk Object protocol. The Chipmunk Object protocol unifies the basic Chipmunk types as well as making it easy to create custom composite collections of the basic types. Additionally, the wrapper adds many convenience methods for doing common setup tasks as well as helper methods that integrate it with the rest of the Cocoa Touch API. The wrapper tries to do things the Objective-C way, adding useful method variations where it makes sense to do so.\
\
The Objective-Chipmunk wrapper is free to use on Mac OS X as well as the iPhone simulator. Access to the iPhone optimized build of the library costs $200 per title to license.
